Sure, here's a high-level outline for dockerizing your Deno app, pushing it to Docker Hub, and setting up a DigitalOcean droplet with a domain to run your app:

1. Dockerize Your Deno App:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for your Deno app.
   - Define the base image, typically a Deno image.
   - Copy your app's code into the container.
   - Specify the command to run your Deno app.

2. Build and Test Your Docker Image:
   - Build your Docker image locally using `docker build`.
   - Run and test the image to ensure it works as expected.

3. Push to Docker Hub:
   - Tag your image for Docker Hub.
   - Log in to Docker Hub using `docker login`.
   - Push your image to Docker Hub with `docker push`.

4. Provision a DigitalOcean Droplet:
   - Create a new droplet via the DigitalOcean dashboard or API.
   - Choose a droplet with Docker pre-installed or install Docker manually.

5. Configure Domain:
   - Point your domain to the droplet's IP address by updating your DNS records.

6. Deploy Your Deno App on the Droplet:
   - Pull your Docker image from Docker Hub onto the droplet.
   - Run your Deno app in a Docker container.
   - Optionally, set up NGINX or another reverse proxy to manage traffic to your app.

7. Automate SSL/TLS Certificate Issuance:
   - Use Certbot in a container or directly on the droplet to obtain SSL/TLS certificates.
